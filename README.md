# Pneumonia Detection Using Neural Networks

## Overview
This project focuses on the detection of pneumonia from chest X-ray images using two different neural network models: a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). These models aim to improve the accuracy and efficiency of pneumonia detection, particularly in settings with limited access to expert radiologists.

## Project Description
The project introduces two neural network models to diagnose pneumonia from chest X-ray pictures. Our CNN model, which is custom-built for this purpose, outperformed the MLP model with an accuracy of 91.02% compared to 76.40% for MLP. We have also developed a user interface that accepts a chest X-ray and predicts the occurrence of pneumonia, including the percentage of congestion. This work not only contributes to the medical field by providing a tool for early detection but also serves as a significant step in the application of machine learning for healthcare improvements.

## Models
- **CNN (Convolutional Neural Network):** This model was built from scratch, focusing on pneumonia detection from chest X-ray images. It achieved higher accuracy and is more efficient in handling image data.
- **MLP (Multilayer Perceptron):** A classic neural network model that, while slightly less accurate than the CNN, still demonstrates the potential for machine learning in medical imaging.

## Usage
Details on how to use these models, including the user interface for pneumonia detection, can be found in the respective directories of this repository.

## Dataset
The models were trained and tested on a dataset consisting of chest X-ray images, labeled as either 'Pneumonia' or 'Normal', sourced from Kaggle. Find the [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia) here
